## Configuration
<!--
We recommend using Python 3 (and pip3) or above. 
-->
* Python 3 or higher
* cvxpy 1.4.2
* numpy 1.26.2
* control 0.9.2

## Get Started
To get started, please run the file ``Predictive Ricatti Control.py`` and  ``Predictive SLS.py``.

The former represents the causal control and predictive control under the Ricatti method. The latter represents the causal control and predictive control under the SLS.
